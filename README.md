# Ancient Pond


This is a dark color scheme for [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/). Since I have more than one machine, I've decided to make it public as a package - it is easier for me to use and maintain.

Why Ancient Pond? I don't know. [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) name generator made it for me.

I use it mostly for C++, but also time to time I add highlights for other languages and formats.
