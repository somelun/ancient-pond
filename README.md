# Ancient Pond


This is a dark color scheme for Sublime Text 3. Since I have more than one machine, I've decided to make it public as a package - easier for me to update.

Why Ancien Pond? I don't know. [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) name generator made it for me.

I use it mostly for C++, but also time to time add highlights for other languages and formats.
